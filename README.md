## What is it?

A very basic C++ library for CSV parsing.

What is CSV ?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values),
a comma-separated values (CSV) file is a delimited text file that uses a comma
to separate values. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record
consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. The use of the comma as a
field separator is the source of the name for this file format. A CSV file
typically stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text, in which case
each line will have the same number of fields.
